# LAN vs WAN

![](images/wan-vs-lan.png)
## What is LAN?

**Local Area Network (LAN)** is a network that connects devices within a small, limited area, like a home, office, or school.

 Itâ€™s typically fast and used for sharing resources like printers, files, and internet access within a close range.

**Example**: The Wi-Fi network in your home or office.

## What is WAN?

**Wide Area Network (WAN)** is a network that spans a large geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs together.

 WANs are usually slower than LANs due to the larger distances, and they rely on external service providers to connect users across cities, countries, or even globally.

**Example**: The internet itself is the largest WAN.

## Key Differences Between LAN and WAN

| **Feature**          | **LAN**                                 | **WAN**                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Geographical Area** | **Small** (home, office)                   | **Large** (city, country, global)          |
| **Speed**            | Typically **faster** (up to 1 Gbps or more) | Generally **slower** (10 Mbps to 100 Mbps) |
| **Ownership**        | Usually **privately** owned (by a business or individual) | Often managed by **third-party providers** |
| **Cost**             | **Low setup** and maintenance costs         | **Higher costs** due to complex infrastructure |

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### LAN
- **Advantages**: Fast, secure, easy to manage, and cost-effective for small areas.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited to a small area.

### WAN
- **Advantages**: Covers vast distances, connects multiple LANs, enables global communication.
- **Disadvantages**: Slower speeds, higher costs, and more complex management.

## Conclusion

- Both LAN and WAN play crucial roles in networking.
-  LAN is ideal for smaller, local networks, while WAN is essential for connecting networks across long distances.
-   Each has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the scale and requirements of the network.
